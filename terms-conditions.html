                        <p>By using yilgo, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by emailing at Support@yilgo.com.</p>

                        <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
                        <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
                            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or yilgo staff cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by contacting Support@yilgo.com customer support team.
                            A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide yilgo with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to telephone number or a valid credit card information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize yilgo app to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
                            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, yilgo reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service with immediate effect.

                        <p>YILGO APP may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
                            You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.
                            If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by yilgo app until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
                            At any time and without notice, YILGO APP reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

                            Yilgo app will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
                            Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
